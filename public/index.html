  <p><br> 
    Chuck E. Cheese's is a chain of family entertainment centers that features pizza, arcade games, and animatronic shows. The concept was created by Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari, in 1977.</p>
  <p><br> Bushnell was inspired by the success of Disneyland and wanted to create a place where families could come to eat, play, and have fun together. He envisioned a restaurant with an arcade, where kids could play games and win tickets that they could redeem for prizes.</p>
  <p><br> The first Chuck E. Cheese's restaurant opened in San Jose, California, in 1977. It featured a cast of animatronic characters, including Chuck E. Cheese, a mouse who played guitar and sang songs. The restaurant was an instant hit, and soon, Bushnell opened more locations across the United States.
  </p>
  <p><br> In 1984, Bushnell sold Chuck E. Cheese's to Showbiz Pizza, another chain of family entertainment centers. Showbiz Pizza merged with Chuck E. Cheese's, and the two brands became one. The new company was called Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre.</p>
  <p><br>Over the years, Chuck E. Cheese's has continued to grow and expand. The chain now has more than 600 locations around the world, and the animatronic characters have evolved to keep up with the times. Today, Chuck E. Cheese's features a mix of classic and modern arcade games, as well as a menu that includes pizza, salads, and desserts.
  </p>
  <p><br> While the chain has faced some challenges in recent years, including bankruptcy and the closure of some locations, it remains a popular destination for families looking for a fun and affordable outing.</p>
<h2>The New Cast</h2>

<p><br> 
  The Chuck E. Cheese's animatronics are a key part of the restaurant's entertainment experience. These animatronic characters are lifelike robots that move, sing, and interact with guests. They are designed to be fun, engaging, and entertaining for children and adults alike.
</p>
<p><br> The original cast of Chuck E. Cheese's animatronic characters included Chuck E. Cheese, a guitar-playing mouse who is the restaurant's mascot, as well as his friends Helen Henny, a singing chicken, Jasper T. Jowls, a hound dog who plays banjo, and Mr. Munch, a purple monster who loves to eat.
</p>
<p><br>Over the years, the animatronic characters have been updated and redesigned to keep up with the times. For example, Chuck E. Cheese's appearance has changed from a rat to a mouse, and his voice has been updated to sound more modern. The animatronics have also been given new songs to sing and new routines to perform.</p>
<p><br> While the animatronics are certainly a highlight of the Chuck E. Cheese's experience, they have also been the subject of some controversy. Some people have criticized the robots for being creepy or outdated, while others have expressed concern about their hygiene and maintenance.</p>
<p><br> Despite these concerns, the Chuck E. Cheese's animatronics continue to be a popular attraction for families looking for a fun and unique entertainment experience.</p>
<p><br> The animatronic characters at Chuck E. Cheese's have evolved over the years, but here are some of the most notable ones:</p>
<p><br> <b>Chuck E. Cheese</b> - the chain's iconic mouse mascot , who plays guitar and sings.
  <p><br> Chuck E. Cheese made his debut in 1977 at the first Pizza Time Theatre restaurant in San Jose, CA2. During the initial planning stages, the idea and design for Chuck E. came from a generic mascot-character costume obtained at an IAAPA trade show by Nolan Bushnell, the co-founder and head of Atari. It was assumed to be a coyote, which prompted the original working title of the restaurant concept to be "Coyote Pizza". Bushnell had the costume shipped back to Atari and once it arrived they noticed a large pink tail indicating it was actually a rat. Rather than find a replacement costume, they kept it and went with the rat theme and changed the restaurant name3. The costume head was handed to Bushnell's engineers who were instructed to "make him talk"4.</p>

<p><br> <b> Helen Henny </b> - a singing chicken who is one of Chuck E. Cheese's best friends.</p>
<p><br> Helen Henny was the very first guest star, having appeared in 1977 while Pizza Time Theatre was still owned by Atari. She again appeared in November, 1978 at the opening of Pizza Time Theatre's second store on Kooser Rd, where she was simply described as "direct from a triumphal tour of Madagascar"1. The concept for Helen Henny was a loose parody of the famous singer Helen Reddy, as the idea for the earliest guests was to base them on famous stars2 such as the concept-characters "Elkton John" and "Glen Camel"</p>
<img src="https://showbizpizza.com/ptp/characters/helen_sm.jpg" height="300" width="400"> 
<p><br><b>Jasper T. Jowls </b>- a banjo-playing hound dog who loves to sing and dance.</p>
<p><br>During his concept design, Jasper was known as Billy "Banjo" Boggs which Atari even went as far as to copyright1, though this working title was changed prior to his introduction at the very first Pizza Time Theatre in 19772. Jasper was described as "the doggondest banjo-strummin', country-singin' hound around. He'll laught at anything!"3 The idea for Jasper came from Robert Allen Black, who worked for the advertising firm used by Atari / Pizza Time Theatre, and Gene Landrum, Pizza Time Theatre's original president. They wanted the show to include a country-western character since country music was gaining in pouplarity at the time.</p>

<p><br><b>Mr. Munch</b> - a purple monster who plays the keyboard and is known for his love of pizza.</p>
<p><br>Mr. Munch originally appeared in November, 1978 at the opening of Pizza Time Theatre's second store on Kooser Rd. He was described as the "purple pizza eater" who loves to pilfer and purloin from Pasqually's kitchen - he sings, laughs, and scares people1. The idea for Mr. Munch came from Michael M. Hatcher, director of entertainment for Pizza Time Theatre. </p>
<img src="https://showbizpizza.com/ptp/characters/munch_sm.jpg" height="300" width="400"> 
<p><br><b>Pasqually</b> - a chef who is often seen cooking up pizza in the restaurant's kitchen.</p>
<p><br>In the beginning at the original Pizza Time Theatre, Pasqually's main purpose was to announce the pizza orders when they were ready, coming out of the kitchen from behind closed doors and calling out to the crowd1. This function was quickly discontinued however as it was nearly impossible to keep up since pizzas were being sold so fast and continuously</p>

<h2>The Old Cast</h2>

<p><br>It's worth noting that not all Chuck E. Cheese's locations have the Warblettes or may have different backup singers or performers. Additionally, the Warblettes themselves may have undergone changes or updates over the years.</p>
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JCJrs6kcPx4/maxresdefault.jpg" height="300" width="400"> 
<p><br><b>Crusty (the Cat)</b></p>
<p><br> Crusty was one of the original Pizza Time Players and was present at the original store in San Jose, CA. He was described as the "Cat's Meow" in singing and joke telling, and was Chuck E. Cheese's straight man. He was dressed in a baseball uniform with the name "swingers" and the number 13 on the front. His caricature in the 1977 Pizza Time Theatre Program also shows him wearing a baseball hat and mitt1.
</p>
<p><br> Early promotional material projected Crusty to be a high-profile character, even though he ultimately ended up as a footnote in the Pizza Time Players history. The 1977 PTT Program shows a special pizza on the menu titled "Crusty's Vegetarian Delight"1.</p>
<p><br>In the end, Crusty wound up being the first Pizza Time Player to face retirement, being replaced by Mr. Munch who was introduced with the opening the second Pizza Time Theatre store in late 19787. Although he was only ever featured in the original location, Crusty was actually given a brand new animatronic design prior to his removal.</p>

She was sultry and spoke in a thick French accent, often singing traditional French songs. The other characters often made fun of her size, and always managed to mess up the pronunciation of her name (she would correct them with the proper pronunciation, "Maah-dahm Ohhnk")1. She would intermittently snort during her speaking and singing, and was flirty with the boys in the audience. She also had a romantic relationship with Pasqually which was referenced on occasion.</p>
<p><br> Madame Oink was the second Pizza Time Theatre Guest Star, originally appearing in February of 19782. She was present at the original store on Winchester Blvd in San Jose, CA and had long white hair and green eyes. Her name was originally spelled Madam Oink, with the spelling changed to Madame Oink in 1979-1980. Madame Oink was based on the famous jazz singer Peggy Lee, and during her development phase she was always referred to as "Piggy Lee"</p>
